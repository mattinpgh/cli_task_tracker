# Log/Diary:

## Day One, January 15th, 2025
* Created basic structure. Made scratchpad.py to start learning argparse
* Working through [the argparse tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html) in the official python docs
* Next steps: 
  * finish [the argparse tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)
  * work through [Real Python's argparse lesson](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/)
  * work through [Creating and packaging command-line tools](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-command-line-tools/)

## Day Two, January 16th, 2025
* Completed working through [the argparse tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)
* Started working through [Real Python's argparse lesson](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/)
  * Made it to [Creating a CLI with `argparse`](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/#creating-a-cli-with-argparse)
    * Detoured to read about the [`ArgumentParser`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser) object
    * Started reading the [`.add_argument()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument) method. Made it to [`BooleanOptionalAction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.BooleanOptionalAction)


**Reflection**: starting to get a handle on how `argparse` works. I still have a lot to read through and a lot to work 
with, but knowing generally what these programs do is making me a little more confident. I know I'm also really weak 
on file handling, so once I finish working through these tutorials, that's where I'm going to head.
